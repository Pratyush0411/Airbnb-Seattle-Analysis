## Airbnb seattle Kaggle Dataset Analysis
For the course, Introduction to data science and artificial intelligence, we had to choose and analyze a dataset of our own from any source. We chose the Airbnb Seattle open dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle.

### Problem Statement
Analyse the listing review ratings and select the features of the listing which impact the review ratings and cost of stay. This was an interesting problem, which we came across while doing exploratory data analysis on the dataset

### Methodology
- Text pre-processing of unstructured review data 
* Exploratory data analysis on the pre-processed data i.e. wordclouds to find the words that impact bad ratings 
* Sentiment Analysis of the pre-processed text data to calculate review rating of each listing
* Exploratory Data analysis of the listings data
* Selection of probable features that may impact the review ratings
* Regression modelling to find out the most important features 
* Classification modelling to predict the categories of the review ratings
* Anomaly detection to detect listings with unusually high or low prices
* Visualization of listings location on map using plotly to gain insights from geolocation data

### Results and Conclusions
* A powerpoint slide has been prepared which covers the insights and conclusions we arrived at from the data - Air BnB Data Science.pptx
